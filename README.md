# VCBackend

VCBackend includes in a single binary demo versions of Issuer, Verifier and Wallet (same-device only, for a cross-device wallet please see [VCWallet](https://github.com/hesusruiz/VCWallet)).

This facilitates installation and allows to see how all components fit together and the protocol flows between them.

## Installation

Clone the repository:

```
git clone git@github.com:hesusruiz/VCBackend.git
```

## Running

The first time that you start the VCBackend you have to make sure the database artifacts are consistent. You can use the provided Makefile for that or run the command directly:

```
make datamodel
```

The above command has to be executed every time that you modify the database model in the application.

To start VCBackend in development mode, type:

```
go run .
```
